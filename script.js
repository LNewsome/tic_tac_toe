$(".button").click(function(){
// everytime a player clicks on a <td> an X or an O shows in the cell.
console.log("I was clicked!");
  // How can tell which cell was clicked on?

  // How can we determine whats in that cell?

  // if the value of the cell is not what we want?
      // change it to the opposite
    
 })

 // when one player completes his turn as X the next players turn becomes O.
